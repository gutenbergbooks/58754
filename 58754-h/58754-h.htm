<p class="noi"><span class="p180">L</span>ITTLE Soffrona lived with a lady who loved her very much. She was not
the lady’s own child, but she was as dear to that lady as if she had
been so, and the child always called her mamma. The lady had a little
girl of her own called Sophia. Sophia was one year older than Soffrona;
and Sophia and Soffrona learned lessons together, and played together,
and were very happy in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span> other’s company. When you saw Soffrona,
you might be sure Sophia was not very far off; and when you saw Sophia,
it was very certain that Soffrona was at no great distance.</p>

<p>How delightful it is for little children to live in love and peace one
with another! Hear what David says on this subject&mdash;&mdash;<cite>Behold, how good
and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</cite> (Psalm
cxxxiii. 1.)</p>

<p>Soffrona and Sophia lived in a very lovely house, surrounded with
woods. Wherever you looked from the windows of that house, you might
see trees growing thickly together, forming beautiful arbours, and
pleasant shades, with little paths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span> winding about among those trees;
and here and there, near the trees, were fountains of water springing
from the hills, and running down into the valleys: for there were hills
there, and the tops of some of them were covered all through the winter
with snow, though in summer they appeared green or blue, according to
the time of the year, and wore a very pleasant aspect.</p>

<p>Soffrona and Sophia were allowed to play in these woods, and they had
learned to run and skip upon the hills like young fawns. It was very
pleasing to see them, and they found many treasures in those wild
places which children who have never been in woods have no idea of.
They found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> snail-shells, and painting-stones, and wild strawberries,
and bilberries, and walnuts, and hazel nuts, and beautiful moss, and
many kinds of flowers; and there they heard birds sing&mdash;cuckoos, and
linnets, and blackbirds, and thrushes; and saw beautiful butterflies
with gold and purple plumes, and dragon-flies, whose wings look like
fine silk net.</p>

<p>One morning in the month of May, Soffrona and Sophia had leave given to
them to play in the woods, after they had finished their lessons, and
they took a basket with them, to bring home any treasures which they
might find. And they went a long way through the woods,&mdash;I dare say
as much as half a mile,&mdash;till they came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span> to a place where an old tree
had been blown down by the side of a brook; and there they sat down,
and each of them took a little penny book to read out of their basket:
and while they were reading, they heard a noise of boys shouting and
laughing, and they jumped up and hid themselves behind some bushes.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img src="images/i_009.jpg" width="400" height="340" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
So the boys came nearer, and went down close to the water’s side; and
the little girls heard them say one to another, “Let us put it in the
deepest place, where it cannot scramble out.” And they saw the boys
stoop over the water and put something into it, and at the same time
they heard a very young kitten cry; and the two little girls could not
stop themselves from screaming out, quite loud, from the midst of the
bushes, saying, “Wicked, cruel boys! what are you doing?”</p>

<p>Now the boys heard the cries of the little girls; and, as the Bible
says, <cite>The wicked flee when no man pursueth</cite>; (Prov. xxviii. 1.) so
they all took to their heels, and ran away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span> as fast as they could,
leaving the poor little kitten in the water.</p>

<p>Soffrona and Sophia did not lose one moment after the boys were gone,
but ran to the brook, and found the little kitten almost dead. However,
they got it out, though they wet themselves up to the knees in so
doing, and they returned to the tree, and Soffrona sat down, and laid
it upon her lap, while Sophia wiped it dry; and as she rubbed it, she
found warmth returning to its little body, and presently it opened its
eyes and began to mew. “O my dear little Puss!” said Soffrona, “how
very glad I am that you are not dead! You shall be my Puss, and I will
call you Muff. Will you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> let her be mine, Sophia? Will you give me your
share of her?”</p>

<p>Sophia did not say a word against this request, for it was the same
to her whether the little kitten was called hers or Soffrona’s, and
she liked to oblige Soffrona: besides, Sophia was a year older than
Soffrona, and it might be expected that she would be more moderate in
her desires, and think less of herself. Sophia had lived twelve months
longer than Soffrona in the world; and how much may a person learn,
with the blessing of God, in twelve months!</p>

<p>So it was agreed that the kitten should belong to Soffrona, and be
called Muff; and when the little girls had dried it as well as they
could,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span> they put it into the basket upon some soft moss, and ran home
with it.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="400" height="308" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The lady was not angry with them for having wetted themselves in the
brook to save a poor little animal’s life, but she hastened to change
their clothes; and then they took the kitten out of the basket, and
procured some milk to feed it with.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img src="images/i_014.jpg" width="400" height="333" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When the fur of the little cat was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> quite dry, it was seen that she was
very beautifully marked. Her legs, and face, and breast, were quite
white, and her back was streaked with yellow and black; so that she
appeared like a fine polished tortoise-shell. But she was only nine or
ten days old, and was not able to lap milk; and this was a great grief
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span> Soffrona and Sophia, for they feared that although she had been
saved from the water, she would surely die of hunger. The little girls
tried to force milk down her throat with a spoon; but the milk ran down
the outside of her mouth, instead of the inside of her throat, and the
little creature’s sides became quite hollow for want of nourishment.</p>

<p>Soffrona was thinking of nothing but Muff all the evening, and she
kept her on her lap while she was reading and while she was eating her
supper. She was, indeed, so much occupied by her little kitten, that,
when the lady asked her to help to make a flannel petticoat for a poor
old woman who lived in a cottage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span> among the hills, not very far off,
she took the needle in her hand, it is true, but I do not think that
she took twenty stitches; for she was looking down every minute upon
the kitten on her lap: and the petticoat would not have been done that
night, if Sophia had not been doubly diligent.</p>

<p>Now it was much to be wished that the petticoat should be done that
night; for it was intended for a good old woman who lived in the woods,
a very poor woman indeed, and the March winds had given her great
pain in her limbs, and she was in much need of a warm petticoat; and,
more than that, the lady had promised the little girls the pleasure
of taking the petticoat, with some tea and sugar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> the next morning,
after they had repeated their lessons, to the cottage. But, as I before
said, Soffrona’s heart was with her kitten, and she could think of
nothing else, and of no other creature. She had no pity left for the
old woman, so much was she thinking of little Muff. We ought to be kind
to animals; but our first affections should be given to our Maker, our
second to our fellow-creatures, and our third to any poor animals which
may be in our power.</p>

<p>The last thing Soffrona did in the evening, was to try to put some
milk down Muff’s throat, and this was the first thing she did in the
morning: and so far she did right, for the poor little thing depended
on her. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span> when she had done all she could for Muff, she should have
given her mind to her other duties; but she could not command herself
to attend to any thing else all that morning, and learned her lessons
so ill, that, if the lady had not been very indulgent, she would have
deprived her of the pleasure of walking with Sophia to see the old
woman, and to carry the petticoat.</p>

<p>There was a neat little maid-servant, called Jane, who used to walk out
with Sophia and Soffrona when they had a long way to go; and Jane was
ready waiting for the little girls by the time the lessons were done.</p>

<p>Sophia had asked leave to carry the basket with the petticoat and the
tea and sugar; and Soffrona took another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> basket, and put a bit of
flannel at the bottom of it, and laid Muff in it, and tied the cover
over it; and when Sophia took up her basket to carry, Soffrona also put
her arm under the handle of Muff’s basket, and went down stairs with it.</p>

<p>When they were got out of the house, Jane said, “What, have you two
baskets, young ladies, full of good things, to carry to old Martha?
Well, I am very glad; for she is a good and pious old woman.”</p>

<p>Soffrona coloured, but did not answer; and Sophia smiled, and said,
“She has not got any thing for the old woman in her basket: she has
only got Muff, wrapped in flannel, in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
“O, Miss!” said Jane, “how can you think of doing such a thing? What a
trouble it will be to you to carry the kitten all the way! and we have
two miles to walk, and most of it up hill. Please to let me carry the
kitten back to the house.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Jane,” said Soffrona, “no, you shall not.”</p>

<p>“<em>Shall</em> not, Miss!” said Jane: “is that a pretty word?”</p>

<p>Soffrona looked very cross, and Jane was turning back to complain to
the lady: but Sophia entreated her not to do it; and Soffrona submitted
to ask her pardon for being rude, and promised to behave better, if
she would permit her to carry the kitten where she was going. So that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
matter was settled, and Jane and the little girls proceeded.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="400" height="318" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I could tell you much about the pretty places through which they passed
in going to poor Martha’s cottage, which were quite new to the little
girls. They first went through some dark woods, where the trees met
over their heads like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> arches in a church; and then they came to
a dingle, where water was running at the bottom, and they crossed the
water by a wooden bridge; then they had to climb up such a steep, such
a very steep hill, covered with bushes; then they came to a high field
surrounded with trees, and in a corner of that field was old Martha’s
thatched cottage. It was a poor place: the walls were black-and-white,
and there were two windows, one of which was in the thatch, and one
below, and a door, half of which was open; for it was such a door as
you see in cottages, the lower part of which can be shut while the
other is open. There was a little smoke coming out of the chimney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> for
Martha was cooking her potatoes for her dinner.</p>

<p>“Do you think Martha has any milk in her house?” said Soffrona; “for
poor Muff must be very hungry by this time.”</p>

<p>“I fear not,” replied Jane: “but come, young ladies, we have been
a long time getting up this hill, and we must be at home by three
o’clock.”</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="400" height="325" alt="" />
</div>

<p>So they went on, and came close to the door, and stood there a little
while, looking in. They saw within the cottage a very small kitchen;
but it was neat, and there was nothing out of its place. There was
a wide chimney in the kitchen; and in the chimney a fire of sticks,
over which hung a little kettle. Old Martha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> was sitting on a stool
within the chimney. She was dressed in a blue petticoat and jacket, and
had a high crowned, old-fashioned felt hat on her head, and a coarse
clean check handkerchief on her neck. Before her was a spinning-wheel,
which she was turning very diligently, for she could not see to do
any work besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span> spinning; and by the fire, on the hob, sat a fine
tortoise-shell cat, which was the old woman’s only companion. “O!”
cried little Soffrona, “there is a cat! I see a cat!”</p>

<p>“Dear, Miss,” said Jane, “you can think of nothing but cats.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jane,” answered Sophia, “and if she is fond of cats, is there
any harm in it?”</p>

<p>Jane could make no answer, for by this time old Martha had seen them,
and came halting on her crutch to meet them, and to offer them all the
seats in her house; and these were only a three-legged stool and two
old chairs.</p>

<p>Sophia then presented the old woman with what she had brought from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> her
mamma, and Jane gave her a bottle of medicine from her pocket: and the
old woman spoke of the goodness of Almighty God, who had put it into
the lady’s heart to provide her with what she needed most in this world.</p>

<p>Now, while Sophia and Jane and Martha were looking over the things
which the lady had sent, the old cat had left the hob, and had come to
Soffrona, and was staring wildly, and mewing in a strange way round
the basket; and at the same time the kitten within began to mew.
“Puss! Puss! pretty Puss!” said Soffrona, for she was half afraid of
this large cat, and yet at the same time very well inclined to form a
friendship with her.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
<img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="400" height="302" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At length, those that were with her in the cottage saw what was
passing; and Martha said, “Don’t be afraid, Miss; Tibby won’t hurt
you. Poor thing! she is in great trouble, and has been so ever since
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“What trouble?” said Soffrona.</p>

<p>“Some rude boys came in yesterday, and stole her kitten,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Martha. “I was in the wood, picking a few sticks, and left the door
open; and the boys came in, and ran away with the kitten; and the
poor cat has been moaning and grieving like a human being,&mdash;poor dumb
thing,&mdash;ever since. The cruel lads! I saw them go down the hill!”</p>

<p>“O!” said Soffrona, “and I do believe”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“And I am sure,” said Sophia.</p>

<p>“And I am so glad!” said Soffrona.</p>

<p>“And how happy she will be!” said Sophia.</p>

<p>And Soffrona immediately set down her basket and opened it, and put
the little kitten on the floor, for the kitten was indeed poor Tibby’s
kitten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
It was a pretty sight, an agreeable and pleasant sight, to behold the
joy of the old cat when she saw her kitten. The poor creature seemed
as if she would have talked. Martha took up the kitten, and laid it on
a little bit of a mat in the corner of the chimney, where it used to
be; and the old cat ran to it, and lay down by it, and gave it milk,
and licked it, and talked to it in her way, (that is, in the way that
cats use to their kittens,) and purred so loud, that you might have
heard her to the very end of the cottage. It was a pleasant sight, as I
said before, for it is a pleasure to see any thing happy; and Soffrona
jumped and capered about the house, and knew not how sufficiently to
express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> her joy: and as for little Sophia, her eyes were filled with
tears; and poor old Martha was not the least happy of the party.</p>

<p>And now, when it was time to go, Soffrona took up her empty basket, and
giving the kitten a kiss, “Little Puss,” she said, “I will rejoice in
your happiness, though it will be a loss to me, for I must part with my
little darling. But I will not be selfish: mamma says that I can never
make myself happy by making other things miserable. Good-bye, little
Puss: if God will help me, I will try never to be selfish.” And she
walked out of the cottage, wiping away her tears.</p>

<p>“But you will let her have Muff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span> won’t you, Martha,” said Sophia,
“when her mother has brought her up, and can part with her?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I will, dear Miss,” replied Martha; “for I was delighted to

others miserable.”</p>

<p>When Muff was a quarter old, she was brought to Soffrona, and became
her cat, and lived in her service till her yellow and black hairs were
mingled with grey.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
